# Welcome to KRYPT

**KRYPT** (*Keep Recording Your Plans and Thoughts*) is a knowledge management web application with AI-augmented functionalities — your personal second brain, reimagined.

---

## What is KRYPT ?

KRYPT is a web-based application designed to help users:

- Organize and structure their thoughts, notes, and research.
- Use modern AI tools (summarization, tagging, semantic search, RAG, etc.) to enrich and retrieve knowledge.
- Connect ideas across documents using embeddings and vector search.
- Stay in control of their data with a self-hostable, privacy-focused setup.

Inspired by tools like **Obsidian** and **Notion**, KRYPT adds a powerful AI layer — but it is **proprietary software** and is **not freely reusable or redistributable**.
