# 👋 Welcome to MindVault

**MindVault** is an open-source initiative to build an intelligent, AI-augmented knowledge management web app - your personal second brain, reimagined.

---

## 🚀 What is MindVault ?

MindVault is a web-based application designed to help users:
- Organize and structure their thoughts, notes, and research.
- Use modern AI tools (summarization, tagging, semantic search, RAG, etc.) to enrich and retrieve knowledge.
- Connect ideas across documents using powerful embeddings and vector search.
- Stay in control of their data, with a self-hostable and privacy-focused setup.

Inspired by tools like **Obsidian** and **Notion**, MindVault adds a powerful AI layer - and remains **free and open-source**.
